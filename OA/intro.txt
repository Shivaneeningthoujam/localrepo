Good evening Sir,
I am Shivanee Ningthoujam from NIT Manipur .I am currently pursuing Btech in CSE.
To start with my skills,I have fairly good foundation in java ,data structure and algorithm and web development. 
I've worked in several projects like complain management system,spotify clone and other small projects.
Talking about my experience , I've completed my internship at BEL  where I gained a hands-on experience in
react js and was able to development a complain management website . In the project, the user is able to complain about 
the issues related to workspace and the admin is able to manage and resolve the issues in his own admin page.
I'm particularly interestd in frontend webdevelopment.I've completed my coursework in the domain.
I believe my skills align well with the requirements of this role and I'm eager to apply them in real-world challenges.
Thank you for the opportunity.
